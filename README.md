# Energy Market Forecasting and Risk Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project leverages **data engineering, machine learning, and financial risk analysis** to forecast energy prices and assess market risks. I have built an **end-to-end pipeline** integrating **Apache Airflow, PostgreSQL, PyTorch, SQL, and Power BI** to analyze energy and weather data from five Spanish cities.  

## 🚀 Key Features  
- **ETL Pipeline:** Designed a scalable **Apache Airflow** pipeline to automate data ingestion, transformation, and storage in **PostgreSQL**.  
- **Energy Price Forecasting:** Developed an **LSTM-based model in PyTorch**, achieving **0.0202 RMSE** on test data.  
- **Risk Analysis:** Calculated **7-day VaR, CVaR, and volatility** using SQL for market risk assessment.  
- **Real-Time Dashboard:** Integrated insights into an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for visualization and decision-making.  

## 🗂️ Data Sources  
- **Energy generation and price data** (Spain, 5 cities)  
- **Weather data** (temperature, wind speed, humidity, etc.)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Apache Airflow** – ETL pipeline automation  
- **PostgreSQL** – Data storage and management  
- **PyTorch** – LSTM model for time-series forecasting  
- **SQL** – Risk metrics computation (VaR, CVaR, volatility)  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard for insights  

## 📊 Results  
- **LSTM Model Performance:** Achieved **0.0202 RMSE** in forecasting energy prices.  
- **Risk Metrics Computed:** 7-day **VaR, CVaR, and volatility** for market risk assessment.
